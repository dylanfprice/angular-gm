/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name angulargm.directive:gmMarkers
 * @element ANY
 *
 * @description
 * A directive for adding markers to a `gmMap`. You may have multiple per `gmMap`.
 *
 * To use, you specify an array of custom objects and tell the directive how to
 * extract an id and position from them. A marker will be created for each of
 * your objects. If you assign a new array to your scope variable or change the
 * array's length (i.e. add or remove an object), the markers will also update.
 * The one case where `gmMarkers` can not automatically detect changes to your
 * objects is when you mutate objects in the array. To inform the directive of
 * such changes, see the `gmMarkersUpdate` event below.
 *
 * Only the `gm-objects`, `gm-id` and `gm-position` attributes are required.
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-objects an array of objects in the current scope.
 * These can be any objects you wish to attach to markers, the only requirement
 * is that they have a uniform method of accessing an id and a position.
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-id an angular expression that given an object from
 * `gm-objects`, evaluates to a unique identifier for that object. Your object
 * can be accessed through the variable `object`. See `gm-position` below for
 * an example.
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-position an angular expression that given an object
 * from `gm-objects`, evaluates to google.maps.LatLngLiteral object. Your
 * object can be accessed through the variable `object`.  For example, if your
 * controller has
 * ```js
 * ...
 * $scope.myObjects = [
 *   { id: 0, location: { lat: 5, lng: 5} },
 *   { id: 1, location: { lat: 6, lng: 6} }
 * ]
 * ...
 * ```
 * then in the `gm-markers` directive you would put
 * ```js
 * ...
 * gm-objects="myObjects"
 * gm-id="object.id"
 * gm-position="object.location"
 * ...
 * ```
 *
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-marker-options an angular expression that given
 * an object from `gm-objects`, evaluates to a
 * [google.maps.MarkerOptions](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#MarkerOptions)
 * object.  Your object can be accessed through the variable `object`. If
 * unspecified, google maps api defaults will be used.
 *
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-events a variable in the current scope that is used to
 * simulate events on markers. Setting this variable to an object of the form
 * ```js
 *     [
 *       {
 *         event: 'click',
 *         ids: [id1, ...]
 *       },
 *       ...
 *     ]
 * ```
 * will generate the named events on the markers with the given ids, if a
 * marker with each id exists. Note: when setting the `gm-events` variable, you
 * must set it to a new object for the changes to be detected.  Code like
 * ```js
 * myEvents[0]["ids"] = [0]
 * ```
 * will not work.
 *
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-on-*event* an angular expression which evaluates to
 * an event handler. This handler will be attached to each marker's \*event\*
 * event.  The variables 'object' and 'marker' evaluate to your object and the
 * [google.maps.Marker](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Marker),
 * respectively. For example:
 * ```html
 * gm-on-click="myClickFn(object, marker)"
 * ```
 * will call your `myClickFn` whenever a marker is clicked.  You may have
 * multiple `gm-on-*event*` handlers, but only one for each type of event.
 * For events that have an underscore in their name, such as
 * 'position_changed', write it as 'gm-on-position-changed'.

/**
 * @ngdoc event
 * @name angulargm.directive:gmMarkers#gmMarkersUpdate
 * @eventOf angulargm.directive:gmMarkers
 * @eventType listen on current gmMarkers scope
 *
 * @description Manually tell the `gmMarkers` directive to update the markers.
 * This is useful to tell the directive when an object from `gm-objects` is
 * mutated--`gmMarkers` can not pick up on such changes automatically.
 *
 * @param {string} objects Not required. The name of the scope variable which
 * holds the objects to update markers for, i.e. what you set `gm-objects` to.
 * It is useful because there may be multiple instances of the `gmMarkers`
 * directive. If not specified, all instances of `gmMarkers` which are child
 * scopes will update their markers.
 *
 * @param {string} objectId Not required. The id of one item from `gm-objects`
 * that has been updated. If provided along with the objects param, only the
 * marker for the one object with that id will be updated. If not provided,
 * all markers will be updated as usual. It can be useful to avoid updating all
 * the markers in a large list after each update when only a single object has
 * changed.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * $scope.$broadcast('gmMarkersUpdate');
 * // or
 * $scope.$broadcast('gmMarkersUpdate', 'myObjects');
 * // or
 * $scope.$broadcast('gmMarkersUpdate', 'myObjects', 'dk37d09blkd2h');
 * ```

 *
 * @description Force the `gmMarkers` directive to clear and redraw all markers.
 *
 * @param {string} objects Not required. The name of the scope variable which
 * holds the objects to redraw markers for, i.e. what you set `gm-objects` to.
 * It is useful because there may be multiple instances of the `gmMarkers`
 * directive. If not specified, all instances of `gmMarkers` which are child
 * scopes will redraw their markers.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * $scope.$broadcast('gmMarkersRedraw', 'myObjects');

 *
 * @param {array} added an array of objects representing the
 * google.maps.Marker objects added. Each object will include `id` and
 * `element` properties. The `id` property will match the evaluated gmId
 * expression for the associated item in gmObjects. The `element` property
 * will contain the google.maps.Marker object.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * $scope.$on('gmMarkersAdded', function(event, objects, added) {

 *
 * @param {string} objects the name of the scope variable which holds the

 *
 * @param {array} removed an array of objects representing the
